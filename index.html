        <h2>About Child Labour</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Child labour refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood,
            interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and is harmful to their physical and mental
            development.</p></li>
            <li> <p>Child labour is the exploitation of children through any form of work that interferes with their ability to attend
            regular school, or is mentally, physically, socially and morally harmful. Such exploitation is prohibited by
            legislation worldwide, although these laws do not consider all work by children as child labour; exceptions
            include work by child artists, family duties, supervised training, and some forms of work undertaken by Amish children,
            as well as by Indigenous children in the Americas</p></li>
            <li> <p>Child labour has existed to varying extents throughout history. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many children
            aged 5â€“14 from poorer families worked in Western nations and their colonies alike. These children mainly worked in
            agriculture, home-based assembly operations, factories, mining, and services such as news boys some worked night
            shifts lasting 12 hours. With the rise of household income, availability of schools and passage of child labour laws,
            the incidence rates of child labour fell</p></li>

        <h1>Issues</h1>
        <p>Child labour often leads to exploitation, lack of education, health issues, and perpetuates the cycle of
            poverty.</p>
        <h1>punishment for employing children in violation of the law ?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Any person who employs a child below 14 or a child between 14 and 18 in a hazardous occupation or process can be
            punished with jail time of between six months and two years and/or fine between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 50,000</p></li>
            <li><p>A person can be punished for all other violations (for example, with respect to maintenance of register, work hours,
            health and safety conditions) with jail time of up to one month and/ or a fine of up to Rs. 10,000. First time offences
            can be settled if the person pays a certain sum of money</p></li>
            <li><p>There are a number of other laws which also punish employment of children. However, prosecution for the crime of
            employing children and adolescents will be under the child labour law. The laws include the Factories Act, Mines Act,
            Merchant Shipping Act and the Motor Transport Workers Act</p></li>

        <h2>Solutions for eradicating the child labour</h2>
        
            <h1>Educating and Advocating</h1>
            <p>Putting an end to child labour begins with spreading awareness among the people. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)
            are the unsung heroes in this fight. Through workshops, plays, and awareness campaigns, they educate communities about
            the grim realities of child labour. Empowering individuals with knowledge enables them to take a stand against this
            injustice. Additionally, NGOs advocate for stronger laws to protect the rights of children.</p>
            <h1>Collaborating with Government Bodies</h1>
            <p>NGOs collaborate closely with government agencies to strengthen existing laws. In India, partnerships with the
            Department of Labor and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) are crucial. Together, they
            ensure that child labour laws are enforced and push for stricter penalties for offenders. They also work towards
            introducing new legislation to address emerging challenges.</p>
            <h1>Providing Safe Havens</h1>
            <p>When children are rescued from exploitative labor, NGOs provide them with a haven. They offer psychological support and
            counseling to help these children overcome their traumatic experiences. Ensuring that rescued children are reintegrated
            into the education system is paramount. NGOs work closely with families and schools to facilitate this transition.</p>
            <h1>Skill Development and Economic Empowerment</h1>
            <p>Economic hardships often force families to resort to child labour. In India, NGOs address this issue by providing
            parents with vocational training, such as sewing or carpentry. Equipped with these skills, parents can earn a living
            wage, reducing the need to send their children to work. Moreover, older children receive training for better employment
            opportunities.</p>
            <h1>Addressing Economic Vulnerability</h1>
            <p>Poverty is a major driver of child labour. Families facing economic hardship often see child labour as their only means
            of survival. To tackle this root cause, NGOs for child labour in India implement poverty alleviation programs. These
            initiatives provide families with access to resources like microloans or vocational training, empowering them to improve
            their economic status without exploiting their children.</p>
            <h1>Empowering Through Knowledge</h1>
            <p>Education is a powerful tool in the fight against child labour. By promoting child education in India, NGOs empower
            communities to understand the importance of schooling and the harmful effects of child labour. Initiatives such as
            school enrollment drives, scholarships, and awareness campaigns play a crucial role in changing societal attitudes
            toward child labour.</p>
